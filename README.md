Wign
====

## A collaboration-based danish sign language encyclopedia
The idea of Wign is inspired from a post by Kenneth Andersen in a blog of [Danish Deaf Youth Association](http://www.ddu.dk) (DDU). Wign is a is about a sign language encyclopedia (not to be confused with dictionary!), which everyone can contribute and share with signs for rarely used terms. A social danish sign language platform very alike Wikipedia.

The process:
```
0%               50%                100%
[###########################...........]
```

The milestones for the proces is at our [To-do](https://github.com/Thanerik/Wign/wiki/To-Do).

## Why github?
The project was run by DDU and [12K](http://www.12k.dk), but failed due to complicated setup and communication issues with the website provider. Now I've taken over the project, and I will make the code behind the project open source and collaboration-based, as Wign self.

The project is run by voluntary efforts by myself, to contribute to a richer sign language sharing among us danish deaf.

**You** are therefore invited to take part in the code and fix out issues and other fuzzies in the codes! [To help with the code](https://github.com/Thanerik/Wign/wiki/To-contribute-to-the-project)
